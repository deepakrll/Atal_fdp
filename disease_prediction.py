from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, roc_curve, auc

# Step 2: Upload Dataset
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload health_data_large.csv

# Step 3: Load Data
df = pd.read_csv("health_data_large.csv")
print("âœ… Dataset Loaded Successfully!\n")
